When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when there is a larger project and many developers from remote locations
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
when one contributor makes change on remote repository it doesnt affect local repository of another contributor
